# label-action [![ts](https://github.com/int128/label-action/actions/workflows/ts.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/int128/label-action/actions/workflows/ts.yaml)

This is a General-purpose action for labels of issue or pull request.

## Getting Started

### Add labels

To add a label to the current issue,

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: int128/label-action@v1
    with:
      add-labels: needs-review
```

This action returns the added labels as `added-labels` output.
If the current issue already has a label, the output does not contain it.

You can determine if the labels have been really added as follows:

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: int128/label-action@v1
    id: add-deploy-label
    with:
      add-labels: deploy
  - if: steps.add-deploy-label.outputs.added == true
    run: echo "The label has been really added"
```

### Remove labels

To remove a label from the current issue,

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: int128/label-action@v1
    with:
      remove-labels: needs-review
```

This action returns the removed labels as `removed-labels` output.
If the current issue does not have a label, the output does not contain it.

### Match labels

To get the labels matched to the patterns,

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: int128/label-action@v1
    id: has-deploy-label
    with:
      match-labels: |
        deploy
        /^deploy-/
  - if: steps.has-deploy-label.outputs.matched == true
    run: echo "The issue has any deploy label"
```

If a pattern string is in the form of `/PATTERN/`, this action performs the regexp match.
Otherwise, this action performs the exact match.
